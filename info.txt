Commit Notes:
3/15/24 1439: adjusted code to run validation and removed the JS validation code from previous. Runs as intended.
1127: created two new branches pre API and post API for the coming work.

10/27 1400 published pag in github points to wrong html. Moved files into backup leaving only current files available.
10/27 1302: Styling work. had a problem with input font color, it was the placeholder font once I figured that out things worked out.  Mostly satisfied with this layout.
10/26 1403: today has been a practice in frustration. In an attempt to simplify code. i removed bookContainer and folded it into bookcase. This led to endless issues with styling. Finally created index2.html style2.css to match up with scripClass2.js. In these files I reverted to yesterdays final saves.  With some minor tweaks things are where they were when this project was not based on classes (performance wise).
10/25/23 1744 created createBookCard for clarity.
1530 This iteration seems to be working.  Fixed bug that was duplicating booContainer.
